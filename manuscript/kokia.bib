We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of practical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate t. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all other forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of the procedure controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of problems for which a procedure with proven FDR control can be offered is greatly increased.},

   abstract = {Previous molecular phylogenetic studies have failed to resolve the branching order among the major cotton (Gossypium) lineages, and it has been unclear whether this reflects actual history (rapid radiation) or sampling properties of the genes evaluated. In this paper, we reconsider the phylogenetic relationships of diploid cotton genome groups using DNA sequences from 11 single-copy nuclear loci (10 293 base pairs [bp]), nuclear ribosomal DNA (695 bp), and four chloroplast loci (7370 bp). Results from individual loci and combined nuclear and chloroplast DNA partitions reveal that the cotton genome groups radiated in rapid succession following the formation of the genus. Maximum likelihood analysis of nuclear synonymous sites shows that this radiation occurred within a time span equivalent to 17\% of the time since the separation of Gossypium from its nearest extant relatives in the genera Kokia and Gossypioides. Chloroplast and nuclear phylogenies differ significantly with respect to resolution of the basal divergence in the genus and to interrelationships among African cottons. This incongruence is due to limited character evolution in cpDNA and either previously unsuspected hybridization or unreliable phylogenetic performance of the cpDNA characters. This study highlights the necessity of using multiple, independent data sets for resolving phylogenetic relationships of rapidly diverged lineages.},

It is morphologically distinct from other allopolyploid Gossypium species, and its phylogenetic relationships with them are uncertain. Chloroplast and ribosomal DNA restriction site variation were used to estimate the phylogeny of the allopolyploids. Gossypium mustelinum is resolved as sister to the remaining allopolyploid species, which include two species-pairs, G. barbadense-G. darwinii and G. hirsutum (including G. lanceolatum)-G. tomentosum. This indication that G. tomentosum is sister to G. hirsutum is supported by allozyme data. Gossypium tomentosum is proposed, based on biogeographic evidence and molecular data, to have originated by transoceanic dispersal from a Mesoamerican progenitor. Few restriction site variants were observed among the allopolyploids, suggesting that present lineages diverged relatively rapidly following polyploidization. Allozyme analysis of 30 G. tomentosum accessions collected from seven islands revealed relatively low levels of genetic diversity: 11 of 50 loci were polymorphic, mean number of alleles per locus was 1.24, and mean panmictic heterozygosity was 0.033. Little geographic patterning of allelic distributions was observed. Despite historical cultivation of G. barbadense and G. hirsutum in Hawaii and the existence of their naturalized derivatives, no allozyme evidence of interspecific introgression into G. tomentosum was detected.},

It is specifically separated from the tribe Hibisceae, the concept of which is thereby narrowed, and emphasis is placed on embryo structure and the presence of pigment glands in delimiting these tribes. These pigment glands are associated with the capacity to synthesize the sesquiterpene-like pigment, gossypol. The Gossypieae appear to be unique in possessing these glands and this capacity. Other distinguishing features of the tribe are noted. The tribe is excluded from the Bombacaceae and provisionally retained in the Malvaceae.

   abstract = {It has long been known that organismal complexity is poorly correlated with genome size and that tremendous variation in DNA content exists within many groups of organisms. This diversity has generated considerable interest in: (1) the identity and relative impact of sequences responsible for genome size variation, and (2) the suite of internal mechanisms and external evolutionary forces that collectively are responsible for the observed diversity. Genome size in any given taxon reflects the net effects of multiple mechanisms of DNA expansion and contraction, which by virtue of their complexity and temporal juxtaposition, may be challenging to tease apart into their constituent contributions. Here we review our current understanding of genome size variation in plants and the spectrum of mechanisms thought to be responsible for this variation. We present a synopsis of the insights into the mechanisms and pace of genome size change that are uniquely facilitated by a phylogenetic perspective, particularly among closely related species. We also highlight recent studies in diverse angiosperm groups where comparative genomic approaches have yielded general insights into the myriad mechanisms responsible for much of the observed genome size variation, most prominently the contribution of transposable elements (TEs). Finally, we draw attention to the possibility of divergence in the relative importance of different mechanisms of genome size evolution during cladogenesis.},

   abstract = {Genome sizes in plants vary over several orders of magnitude, reflecting a combination of differentially acting local and global forces such as biases in indel accumulation and transposable element proliferation or removal. To gain insight into the relative role of these and other forces, approximately 105 kb of contiguous sequence surrounding the cellulose synthase gene CesA1 was compared for the two coresident genomes (AT and DT) of the allopolyploid cotton species, Gossypium hirsutum. These two genomes differ approximately twofold in size, having diverged from a common ancestor approximately 5-10 million years ago (Mya) and been reunited in the same nucleus at the time of polyploid formation, approximately 1-2 Mya. Gene content, order, and spacing are largely conserved between the two genomes, although a few transposable elements and a single cpDNA fragment distinguish the two homoeologs. Sequence conservation is high in both intergenic and genic regions, with 14 conserved genes detected in both genomes yielding a density of 1 gene every 7.5 kb. In contrast to the twofold overall difference in DNA content, no disparity in size was observed for this 105-kb region, and 555 indels were detected that distinguish the two homoeologous BACs, approximately equally distributed between AT and DT in number and aggregate size. The data demonstrate that genome size evolution at this phylogenetic scale is not primarily caused by mechanisms that operate uniformly across different genomic regions and components; instead, the twofold overall difference in DNA content must reflect locally operating forces between gene islands or in largely gene-free regions.},

   abstract = {Genome sizes vary by several orders of magnitude, driven by mechanisms such as illegitimate recombination and transposable element proliferation. Prior analysis of the CesA region in two cotton genomes that diverged 5-10 million years ago (Ma), and acquired a twofold difference in genome size, revealed extensive local conservation of genic and intergenic regions, with no evidence of the global genome size difference. The present study extends the comparison to include BAC sequences surrounding the gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase A (AdhA) from four cotton genomes: the two co-resident genomes (A(T) and D(T)) of the allotetraploid, Gossypium hirsutum, as well as the model diploid progenitors, Gossypium arboreum (A) and Gossypium raimondii (D). In contrast to earlier work, evolution in the AdhA region reflects, in a microcosm, the overall difference in genome size, with a nearly twofold difference in aligned sequence length. Most size differences may be attributed to differential accumulation of retroelements during divergence of the genome diploids from their common ancestor, but in addition there has been a biased accumulation of small deletions, such that those in the smaller D genome are on average twice as large as those in the larger A genome. The data also provide evidence for the global phenomenon of 'genomic downsizing' in polyploids shortly after formation. This in part reflects a higher frequency of small deletions post-polyploidization, and increased illegitimate recombination. In conjunction with previous work, the data here confirm the conclusion that genome size evolution reflects many forces that collectively operate heterogeneously among genomic regions.},

   abstract = {The DNA content of eukaryotic nuclei (C-value) varies approximately 200,000-fold, but there is only a approximately 20-fold variation in the number of protein-coding genes. Hence, most C-value variation is ascribed to the repetitive fraction, although little is known about the evolutionary dynamics of the specific components that lead to genome size variation. To understand the modes and mechanisms that underlie variation in genome composition, we generated sequence data from whole genome shotgun (WGS) libraries for three representative diploid (n = 13) members of Gossypium that vary in genome size from 880 to 2460 Mb (1C) and from a phylogenetic outgroup, Gossypioides kirkii, with an estimated genome size of 588 Mb. Copy number estimates including all dispersed repetitive sequences indicate that 40\%-65\% of each genome is composed of transposable elements. Inspection of individual sequence types revealed differential, lineage-specific expansion of various families of transposable elements among the different plant lineages. Copia-like retrotransposable element sequences have differentially accumulated in the Gossypium species with the smallest genome, G. raimondii, while gypsy-like sequences have proliferated in the lineages with larger genomes. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated a pattern of lineage-specific amplification of particular subfamilies of retrotransposons within each species studied. One particular group of gypsy-like retrotransposon sequences, Gorge3 (Gossypium retrotransposable gypsy-like element), appears to have undergone a massive proliferation in two plant lineages, accounting for a major fraction of genome-size change. Like maize, Gossypium has undergone a threefold increase in genome size due to the accumulation of LTR retrotransposons over the 5-10 Myr since its origin.},

   abstract = {• Background and Aims Gossypium is an economically important, globally distributed taxon comprising more than 50 species. DNA content estimates from about half of the species indicate over a 3-fold variation exists. However, the nine DNA content estimates for G. hirsutum reveal over a 2-fold difference for this species alone. Recent reports have shown that several plant compounds can bias DNA content estimates obtained by commonly used methods. The purpose of this research was to examine the standardization procedures used for DNA content determinations with flow cytometry as applied to Gossypium, and generate revised DNA content estimates for all available Gossypium species using best-standard practices.• Methods Flow cytometry was used to measure fluorescence of isolated Gossypium nuclei stained with propidium iodide. Fluorescence values were converted to DNA content estimates based on the nuclear fluorescence of standard genotypes of barley, corn and rice. Various combinations of nuclei preparations relative to the standards were evaluated for their influence on the estimates.• Key Results Both external standardization and internal standardization with Oryza sativa ‘IR36’ yielded statistically similar DNA content estimates for Gossypium. Internal standardization with Hordeum vulgare ‘Sultan’ resulted in a high estimate of DNA content. Nuclear DNA content estimates were generated for 37 Gossypium species using external standardization. Estimates of ancestral genome sizes reveal that both increases and decreases in nuclear DNA content have occurred. Variation in intraspecific and intragenomic DNA content was low, and the allopolyploid AD-genome size was nearly the additive of its progenitor genomes.• Conclusions Due to unknown factors, internal standardization with H. vulgare ‘Sultan’ may not be appropriate for DNA content determinations of Gossypium. The current DNA content estimates support accepted cytogenetic divisions of the genus. Gossypium is a genus that exhibits genome constancy both through speciation within genomic groups and allopolyploidization.},

However, there is ongoing debate regarding the relative importance of amplification of repetitive DNA versus its deletion in governing genome size. * Using data from 454 sequencing, we analysed the most repetitive fraction of some of the largest known genomes for diploid plant species, from members of Fritillaria. * We revealed that genomic expansion has not resulted from the recent massive amplification of just a handful of repeat families, as shown in species with smaller genomes. Instead, the bulk of these immense genomes is composed of highly heterogeneous, relatively low-abundance repeat-derived DNA, supporting a scenario where amplified repeats continually accumulate due to infrequent DNA removal. * Our results indicate that a lack of deletion and low turnover of repetitive DNA are major contributors to the evolution of extremely large genomes and show that their size cannot simply be accounted for by the activity of a small number of high-abundance repeat families.},

Slightly more distant are the North American n = 7 Arabis (Boechera) species. The genus Arabis is polyphyletic—some unrelated species appear within this taxonomic classification, which has little phylogenetic meaning. Fossil pollen data were used to compute a synonymous substitution rate of 1.5 × 10 substitutions per site per year for both Chs and Adh. Arabidopsis thaliana diverged from its nearest relatives about 5 MYA, and from Brassica roughly 24 MYA.

   abstract = {The identification of orthologous groups is useful for genome annotation, studies on gene/protein evolution, comparative genomics, and the identification of taxonomically restricted sequences. Methods successfully exploited for prokaryotic genome analysis have proved difficult to apply to eukaryotes, however, as larger genomes may contain multiple paralogous genes, and sequence information is often incomplete. OrthoMCL provides a scalable method for constructing orthologous groups across multiple eukaryotic taxa, using a Markov Cluster algorithm to group (putative) orthologs and paralogs. This method performs similarly to the INPARANOID algorithm when applied to two genomes, but can be extended to cluster orthologs from multiple species. OrthoMCL clusters are coherent with groups identified by EGO, but improved recognition of “recent” paralogs permits overlapping EGO groups representing the same gene to be merged. Comparison with previously assigned EC annotations suggests a high degree of reliability, implying utility for automated eukaryotic genome annotation. OrthoMCL has been applied to the proteome data set from seven publicly available genomes (human, fly, worm, yeast, Arabidopsis, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and Escherichia coli). A Web interface allows queries based on individual genes or user-defined phylogenetic patterns (http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/gene-family). Analysis of clusters incorporating P. falciparum genes identifies numerous enzymes that were incompletely annotated in first-pass annotation of the parasite genome.},

In this study, the isolation of three loci from the California fan palm (Washingtonia robusta) is reported. The three loci from palm are highly diverged. One palm Adh gene, referred to here as adhB, has been completely sequenced, including 950 nucleotides of the upstream regulatory region. For the second locus, adhA, 81\% of the exon sequence is complete. Both show the same basic structure as grass Adh genes in terms of intron number and intron location. The third locus, adhC, for which only a small amount of sequence is available (12\% of exon sequence) appears to be more highly diverged. Comparison of the Adh gene families from palms and grasses shows that the adh1 and adh2 genes of grasses, and the adhA and adhB genes of palms, arose by duplication following the divergence of the two families. This finding suggests that the multiple Adh loci in different monocot lineages are not the result of a single ancestral duplication but, rather, of multiple duplication events.},

Although the recent availability of high-throughput sequencing data provides necessary resources for in-depth investigation of genomic repeats, its utility is hampered by the lack of specialized bioinformatics tools and appropriate computational resources that would enable large-scale repeat analysis to be run by biologically oriented researchers.Results: Here we present RepeatExplorer, a collection of software tools for characterization of repetitive elements, which is accessible via web interface. A key component of the server is the computational pipeline using a graph-based sequence clustering algorithm to facilitate de novo repeat identification without the need for reference databases of known elements. Because the algorithm uses short sequences randomly sampled from the genome as input, it is ideal for analyzing next-generation sequence reads. Additional tools are provided to aid in classification of identified repeats, investigate phylogenetic relationships of retroelements and perform comparative analysis of repeat composition between multiple species. The server allows to analyze several million sequence reads, which typically results in identification of most high and medium copy repeats in higher plant genomes.Implementation and availability: RepeatExplorer was implemented within the Galaxy environment and set up on a public server at http://repeatexplorer.umbr.cas.cz/.

Two independent domestication events have been identified in allopolyploid cotton, one in Upland cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L.) and the other to Egyptian cotton ( Gossypium barbadense L.). However, two diploid cotton species, Gossypium arboreum L. and Gossypium herbaceum L., have been cultivated for several millennia, but their status as independent domesticates has long been in question. Using genome resequencing data, we estimated the global abundance of various repetitive DNAs. We demonstrate that, despite negligible divergence in genome size, the two domesticated diploid cotton species contain different, but compensatory, repeat content and have thus experienced cryptic alterations in repeat abundance despite equivalence in genome size. Evidence of independent origin is bolstered by estimates of divergence times based on molecular evolutionary analysis of f7,000 orthologous genes, for which synonymous substitution rates suggest that G. arboreum and G. herbaceum last shared a common ancestor approximately 0.4–2.5 Ma. These data are incompatible with a shared domestication history during the emergence of agriculture and lead to the conclusion that G. arboreum and G. herbaceum were each domesticated independently.},

At the tribal level, phylogenetic analyses of nuclear ribosomal ITS sequences yielded trees that are highly congruent with those derived from the plastid gene ndhF, except for species that have a reticulate evolutionary history or for clades supported by few characters. Problematic taxa were then pruned from the data sets and the phylogeny was inferred from the combined data. Results indicate that 1) the Gossypieae is monophyletic, with one branch from the first split being represented by modern Cienfuegosia; 2) Thespesia is not monophyletic, and 3) Gossypium is monophyletic and sister to an unexpected clade consisting of the Hawaiian genus Kokia and the east African/Madagascan genus Gossypioides. Based on the magnitude of ndhF sequence divergence, we suggest that Kokia and Gossypioides diverged from each other in the Pliocene, subsequent to their apparent loss of a pair of chromosomes via chromosome fusion. Phylogenetic relationships among species and "genome groups" in Gossypium were assessed using cpDNA restriction site variation and ITS sequence data. Both data sets support the monophyly of each genome group, once taxa known or suspected to have reticulate histories are pruned from the trees. There was little congruence between these two data sets, however, with respect to relationships among genome groups. Statistical tests indicate that most incongruence is not significant and that it probably reflects insufficient information rather than a biological process that has differentially affected the data sets. We propose that the differing cpDNA- and ITS-based resolutions of genome groups in Gossypium reflect temporally closely spaced divergence events early in the diversification of the genus. This "short internode" phenomenon is suggested to be a common cause of phylogenetic incongruence.},

All three species are federally endangered, two (K. cookei and K. drynarioides) critically so, and one (K. kauaiensis) is rare but with several populations. Samples extracted were PCR amplified with 10 primers to yield 115 genetic markers. Analyses indicate that genetic variation is present in all three species; a surprising result given that K. cookei survives only from self-fertilized propagules of the single surviving individual that was grafted on to the root stock of a related species, K. drynarioides. Principal coordinates and cluster analyses based on RAPD markers indicate that although K. kauaiensis has substantial genetic variation, samples are clearly separate from the other two species of the genus. In contrast, K. cookei and K. drynarioides collections are more similar but still distinguishable when analyzed separately. Presence of substantial genetic variation lends optimism to the eventual recovery of K. kauaiensis through conservation efforts. Combinations of RAPD primers are suggested that reveal diagnostic alleles for each of the three extant species and can thus be used for species identification.},

The same question may be raised concerning the origin of the amphidiploid cottons as a whole, since their putative parents (or the diploid species most nearly related to them) are confined to Africa and America, respectively. Tests of seed buoyancy and seed viability in experimental tanks of salt water indicate that the upper time limit for seed buoyancy is a little over two months. This is sufficient to effect the transport of seeds over relatively short distances (e.g., throughout the Caribbean islands and from mainland South America to the Galapagos Islands) but totally inadequate for trans-Atlantic or trans-Pacific dispersal. If one accepts the possibility of seeds being "rafted" over longer distances, the experiments indicate that the seeds of the Hawaiian wild species, G. sandvicense, have sufficient tolerance to salt water immersion to have been carried from the Central American mainland to their present location (a required period of nine months). Seeds of the Wake Island form of hirsutum have salt water tolerance comparable to that of sandvicense, but it seems doubtful that this would be sufficient to maintain them for the necessary period of time (19 months). The other Pacific forms tested lack the degree of salt water tolerance required to have reached their present locations as a result of oceanic drift. Reasons are given for believing that these forms arrived from Central America by some route other than the South Pacific Equatorial Current. The seeds of neither G. herbaceum var africanum nor G. anomalum (relatives of the diploid parents of New World cottons) appear to have sufficient salt water tolerance to survive a trans-Atlantic crossing.},

In this study, variation in the maternally inherited chloroplast genome was assessed among species representing both of the parental genomes and the tetraploids. Approximately 560 restriction sites were assayed in each accession, representing sequence information for about 3200 nucleotides. The resulting maternal phylogeny has no convergent restriction site mutations and demonstrates that the cytoplasm donor for all tetraploid species was an A genome diploid with a chloroplast genome that is similar to Gossypium arboreum and Gossypium herbaceum. No mutational differences were detected between these two species, and few mutations distinguish the chloroplast genomes of A genome diploids from those of tetraploid taxa. In contrast to expectations based on extensive taxonomic, geographic, and genetic diversity, a surprisingly low level of sequence divergence has accumulated subsequent to polyploidization. Chloroplast genomes of tetraploid species are distinguished from each other by between one and six apparent point mutations. The data suggest that tetraploid cotton originated relatively recently, perhaps within the last 1-2 million years, with subsequent rapid evolution and diversification throughout the New World tropics.},

One hundred thirty-five of the 202 restriction site variants detected were potentially synapomorphous and served as binary characters for phylogeny estimation. Two cladistic methods were employed: Wagner parsimony analysis, which resulted in four equally most-parsimonious topologies requiring 161 steps (CI = 0.84), and a novel character-state weighting approach that models the relative probabilities of restriction site losses versus gains. This latter technique, which is theoretically preferable to both Dollo and Wagner parsimony analysis in that it optimizes against parallel site gains, resulted in two optimal phylogenetic estimates (a subset of the Wagner topologies) that differ only in the placement of G. longicalyx. In general, maternal cladistic relationships are congruent with both cytogenetic groupings and geographic clustering. Three major monophyletic clades among diploid species correspond to three continents: Australia (C-, G-genome), the Americas (D-genome), and Africa (A-, E-, and F-genome). African B-genome diploids are placed as sister to the New World D-genome species, albeit by a single homoplasious character state. Substantial agreement is also evident between the cpDNA phylogeny and traditional taxonomic treatments, although there is considerable disagreement at lower infrageneric ranks, particularly among the American and Australian cottons. These discrepancies are discussed, as is the possibility that inconsistency may reflect, at least in part, reticulation events among diploids, which may have occurred in at least three cases. An area cladogram suggests that Gossypium originated in either Africa or Australia. Because paleocontinental reconstructions, palynological evidence and cpDNA sequence divergence estimates concur in suggesting that the two primary clades diverged during the mid to upper Oligocene, the initial cladogenetic event most likely involved long-distance, intercontinental dispersal. Two colonizations of the New World are indicated, a relatively early long-distance dispersal from Africa leading to the evolution of the D-genome diploids, and a second, later dispersal of the maternal, A-genome ancestor of the allopolyploids. American diploid species are hypothesized to have originated in northwestern Mexico, with later radiations into other regions. The radiation of Gossypium in Australia is suggested to have proceeded from the westernmost portion of the continent. The maternal phylogenetic hypothesis and area cladogram suggest the possibility that New World allopolyploids originated following a trans-Pacific transfer of an ancestral A-genome taxon to the Pacific coast of Mesoamerica or South America.},

Included are four species that have independently been domesticated for their fiber, two each in Africa–Asia and the Americas. Gossypium species exhibit extraordinary morphological variation, ranging from herbaceous perennials to small trees with a diverse array of reproductive and vegetative characteristics. A parallel level of cytogenetic and genomic diversity has arisen during the global radiation of the genus, leading to the evolution of eight groups of diploid (n=13) species (genome groups A–G, and K). The evolutionary history of the genus included multiple episodes of trans-oceanic dispersal, invasion of new ecological niches, and a surprisingly high frequency of natural interspecific hybridization among lineages that are presently both geographically isolated and intersterile. Recent investigations have clarified many aspects of this history, including relationships within and among the eight genome groups, the domestication history of each of the four cultivated species, and the origin of the allopolyploid cottons. Data implicate an origin for Gossypium 5–15 million years ago (mya) and a rapid early diversification of the major genome groups. Allopolyploid cottons appear to have arisen within the last million years, as a consequence of trans-oceanic dispersal of an A-genome taxon to the New World followed by hybridization with an indigenous D-genome diploid. Subsequent to formation, allopolyploids radiated into three modern lineages, including those containing the commercially important species G. hirsutum and G. barbadense. Genome doubling has led to an array of molecular genetic interactions, including inter-locus concerted evolution, differential rates of genomic evolution, inter-genomic genetic transfer, and probable alterations in gene expression. The myriad underlying mechanisms are also suggested to have contributed to both ecological success and agronomic potential.},

Because DNA content varies over a sevenfold range among diploid species in the cotton genus (Gossypium) and its allies, this group offers opportunities for exploring patterns and mechanisms of genome size evolution. For example, the question has been raised whether plant genomes have a ‘one-way ticket to genomic obesity’, as a consequence of retroelement accumulation. Few empirical studies directly address this possibility, although it is consistent with recent insights gleaned from evolutionary genomic investigations. We used a phylogenetic approach to evaluate the directionality of genome size evolution among Gossypium species and their relatives in the cotton tribe (Gossypieae, Malvaceae). Our results suggest that both DNA content increase and decrease have occurred repeatedly during evolution. In contrast to a model of unidirectional genome size change, the frequency of inferred genome size contraction exceeded that of expansion. In conjunction with other evidence, this finding highlights the dynamic nature of plant genome size evolution, and suggests that poorly understood genomic contraction mechanisms operate on a more extensive scale that previously recognized. Moreover, the research sets the stage for fine-scale analysis of the evolutionary dynamics and directionality of change for the full spectrum of genomic constituents.},

The former is endemic to five of the larger islands of the Galapagos, whileG. davidsonii is restricted to the southern half of Baja California, approximately 2 500 km distant. A substantial body of genetic and taxonomic data suggests that these two species are related as progenitor and derivative. Interspecific hybrids are fully fertile, with no evidence of F2 breakdown and normal segregation of genetic markers. Allozyme analysis of 33 populations for 41 loci indicated that the allelic composition ofG. klotzschianum represents a subset ofG. davidsonii. Although genetic diversity is relatively restricted in both species, calculated measures demonstrate higher levels of genetic variability and greater population structuring inG. davidsonii than inG. klotzschianum. The interspecific genetic identity of 0.87 is typical for progenitor-derivative species pairs. Chloroplast DNAs were surveyed for variation with 25 restriction enzymes using hybridization probes that cover the entire chloroplast genome. No intraspecific and little interspecific variation was detected among 560 cpDNA restriction sites, representing sequence information for approximately 3200 nucleotides. Only 3 mutational differences distinguished the two species, resulting in a sequence divergence estimate of 0.09\%. Divergence times were estimated from both the isozyme data and the cpDNA restriction site data. Although these estimates have several sources of error, both molecular data sets were congruent in suggesting that the two lineages diverged between 250000 and 700000 years ago. Accumulated evidence suggests that dispersal was from Baja California to the Galapagos Islands rather than the reverse, and most likely was mediated by trans-oceanic drift.G. klotzschianum may be the only species of the endemic Galapagos flora to have arisen from a northern Mexican progenitor.},

   abstract = {PAML, currently in version 4, is a package of programs for phylogenetic analyses of DNA and protein sequences using maximum likelihood (ML). The programs may be used to compare and test phylogenetic trees, but their main strengths lie in the rich repertoire of evolutionary models implemented, which can be used to estimate parameters in models of sequence evolution and to test interesting biological hypotheses. Uses of the programs include estimation of synonymous and nonsynonymous rates (dN and dS) between two protein-coding DNA sequences, inference of positive Darwinian selection through phylogenetic comparison of protein-coding genes, reconstruction of ancestral genes and proteins for molecular restoration studies of extinct life forms, combined analysis of heterogeneous data sets from multiple gene loci, and estimation of species divergence times incorporating uncertainties in fossil calibrations. This note discusses some of the major applications of the package, which includes example data sets to demonstrate their use. The package is written in ANSI C, and runs under Windows, Mac OSX, and UNIX systems. It is available at http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html.},
